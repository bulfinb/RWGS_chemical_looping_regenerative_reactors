## 1 Thermodynami modelling
This folder includes the code used for modelling of thermodynamic limits for conventional catalytic reverse water-gas-shift and countercurrent membrane reverse water-gas-shift. There are individual python files or a Jupyter notebook with comments.

## 2 1D reactor model
This folder includes the code used for modelling of thermodynamic limits for conventional catalytic reverse water-gas-shift and countercurrent membrane reverse water-gas-shift.

## 3 PBR experiments
This folder contains the data and data anlysis from the packed bed reactor experiments.
