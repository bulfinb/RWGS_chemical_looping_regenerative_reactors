Intensification of the reverse water-gas shift process using a countercurrent chemical looping regenerative reactor,
Chemical Engineering Journal, 2023, 141896, ISSN 1385-8947

## 1 Ideal countercurrent RWGS
This folder includes the code used for modelling of thermodynamic limits for conventional catalytic reverse water-gas-shift and countercurrent membrane reverse water-gas-shift as seen in figure 2 of the manuscript. There are individual python files or a Jupyter notebook with comments.

## 2 1D reactor model
This folder includes our implementation of the 1D reactor as illustrated in tfigure 3 of the manuscript, including; the comsol model files, exported results and plotting scripts. 

## 3 PBR experiments
This folder contains the experimental data collected and data anlysis from the packed bed reactor experiments as illustrated in figures 4 and 5.
