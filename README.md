[Note: Add doi with link to paper and citation when accepted]

## 1 Ideal countercurrent RWGS
This folder includes the code used for modelling of thermodynamic limits for conventional catalytic reverse water-gas-shift and countercurrent membrane reverse water-gas-shift. There are individual python files or a Jupyter notebook with comments.

## 2 1D reactor model
This folder includes the code used for modelling of thermodynamic limits for conventional catalytic reverse water-gas-shift and countercurrent membrane reverse water-gas-shift.

## 3 PBR experiments
This folder contains the experimental data collected and data anlysis from the packed bed reactor experiments.
